Sean Illing speaks with Alana Newhouse about an essay she published in Tablet magazine this past November. The discussion presents the idea that American society is breaking into two camps - those who believe America&rsquo;s institutions are irreparably broken and need to be replaced with something new (Brokenists) and the Reformists. The latter believe that the institutions are still solid, and only need to be improved. The Brokenist / Reformist dichotomy doesn&rsquo;t align with this country&rsquo;s usual binary divisions. I found the conversation fascinating. It will color how I evaluate current events from now on.</p>\n",
